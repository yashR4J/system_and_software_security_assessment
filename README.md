# System and Software Security Assessment

This repository contains course materials related to cyber attacks and defense mechanisms. The course content was targeted to improve our understanding on how to assess, identify, and exploit vulnerabilities, studying both the theoretical principles and practical approaches to cybersecurity. 

Key aspects include participation in war games (weekly ctf activities), analysis of real-world vulnerabilities in complex, widely-used software systems, and gaining hands-on experience in identifying and mitigating low-level software vulnerabilities. 

Some of the concepts covered in this course include:

    Vulnerability Classes
    Source Code Auditing
    Fuzzing
    Security Bugs
    Software Security Assurance
    Taint Analysis
    Memory Corruption
    Buffer Overflows
    Return-Oriented Programming (ROP)
